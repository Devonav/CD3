This code constitutes an implementation of a simplified processor in C, containing various components necessary for the execution of MIPS-like instructions. Below is an overview of the functionalities provided by different functions in the code:

ALU Operations: This section defines an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, logical AND, logical OR, shifting, and comparison operations (set if less than) both for signed and unsigned numbers.

Instruction Fetch: This function retrieves instructions from memory based on the Program Counter (PC) value provided.

Instruction Partition: This function breaks down the fetched instruction into its constituent parts including opcode, registers, immediate values, and jump addresses.

Instruction Decode: It decodes the opcode to determine the control signals necessary for executing the instruction. Control signals include those for register operations, memory operations, ALU operations, branching, and jumping.

Read Register: This function reads data from the registers specified in the instruction.

Sign Extend: It extends the immediate value from 16 bits to 32 bits, preserving the sign bit.

ALU Operations (extended): A wrapper function that determines the ALU operation based on the ALU control and function fields.

Read/Write Memory: Reads from or writes to memory based on control signals.

Write Register: Writes back data to the register file based on control signals.

PC Update: Updates the Program Counter based on control signals such as branching, jumping, and the result of the ALU operation.
