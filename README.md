This code constitutes an implementation of a simplified processor in C, containing various components necessary for the execution of MIPS-like instructions. Below is an overview of the functionalities provided by different functions in the code:

ALU Operations: This section defines an Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) capable of performing arithmetic and logical operations such as addition, subtraction, logical AND, logical OR, shifting, and comparison operations (set if less than) both for signed and unsigned numbers.

Instruction Fetch: This function retrieves instructions from memory based on the Program Counter (PC) value provided.

Instruction Partition: This function breaks down the fetched instruction into its constituent parts including opcode, registers, immediate values, and jump addresses.

Instruction Decode: It decodes the opcode to determine the control signals necessary for executing the instruction. Control signals include those for register operations, memory operations, ALU operations, branching, and jumping.

Read Register: This function reads data from the registers specified in the instruction.

Sign Extend: It extends the immediate value from 16 bits to 32 bits, preserving the sign bit.

ALU Operations (extended): A wrapper function that determines the ALU operation based on the ALU control and function fields.

Read/Write Memory: Reads from or writes to memory based on control signals.

Write Register: Writes back data to the register file based on control signals.

PC Update: Updates the Program Counter based on control signals such as branching, jumping, and the result of the ALU operation.



The code is organized into functions, each handling a specific aspect of the processor's functionality. It follows a modular approach to facilitate easy understanding, maintenance, and modification. The functions work together to execute instructions fetched from memory, manipulating data and control flow as specified by the MIPS-like instruction set architecture.

This code serves as a foundation for building a functional processor simulator or emulator. It can be extended and integrated with additional components to create a more comprehensive simulation environment for educational or testing purposes.



Command-Line Interface
Once the program is running, you'll be prompted with a command-line interface where you can enter various commands to interact with the MIPS simulator. Here are the available commands:

g: Display control signals.
r: Dump register contents.
m [start] [end]: Dump memory contents in hexadecimal format. If start and end are not provided, dumps entire memory.
s [steps]: Execute the specified number of steps. If no steps are provided, executes one step.
c: Continue execution until halted.
h: Display whether the processor is halted.
p: Display the contents of the input file.
i: Display the total size of memory.
d [start] [end]: Dump memory contents in decimal format. Requires start and end addresses.
x or q: Quit the simulator.
